Shiny App using leaflet

This App shows the Children's lead exposure in Minneapolis using the Elevated blood lead level at census tract level. Elevated blood lead level (EBLL) is defined as a confirmed result at or above 5 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood (mcg/dL).‚Äù EBLLs in young children are linked with adverse health effects, including learning problems, behavioral problems, and even death if exposures are very high. Children less than 6 years of age living in homes built before 1978 are most at risk for lead exposure. Younger children are at greater risk because their bodies absorb lead more easily and their brains are still developing.

In this App, by selecting a EBLL level then click display tracts, then the tracts with the selected EBLL would be added to display, this gives residents a rough idea of how much their children are exposed to lead.
